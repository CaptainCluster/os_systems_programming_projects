This repository contains the source code for three projects I built for the
LUT University course "Käyttöjärjestelmät ja Systeemiohjelmointi", aka 
Operating Systems and Systems Programming.

Compiling
---

While there are multiple files, they are included in a way where they are pretty
much compiled as if they are in one file. This means that compiling the main
file is enough. I found the projects simple enough and chose to follow this 
practice.

Project 1:

> gcc -o reverse reverse.c

Project 2:

> gcc -o my-cat my-cat.c

> gcc -o my-grep my-grep.c

> gcc -o my-zip my-zip.c

> gcc -o my-unzip my-unzip.c 

Project 3:

> gcc -o wish wish.c

Sources

Each project directory has its own README.md file. They show the sources used 
for the projects.
